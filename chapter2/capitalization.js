// Binding names may not contain spaces, yet it is often helpful to use multiple words to clearly describe what the binding represents.
// These are pretty much your choices for writing a binding name with several words in it:
fuzzylittleturtle
fuzzy_little_turtle
FuzzyLittleTurtle
fuzzyLittleTurtle

// The first style can be hard to read.
// I rather like the look of the underscores, though that style is a little painful to type.
// The standard JavaScript functions, and most JavaScript programmers, follow the bottom style -- they capitalize every word except the first.
// It is not hard to get used to little things like that, and code with mixed naming styles can be jarring to read, so we follow this convention.

// In a few cases, such as the *Number* function, the first letter of binding is also capitalized. 
// This was doe to mark this function as a constructor. What a constructor is will become clear in later on. 
// For now, the important thing is not to be bothered by this apparent lack of consistency.
