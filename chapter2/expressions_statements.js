// A fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression.
// Every value that is written literally (such as 22 or "psychoanalysis") is an expression.

// If an expression corresponds to a sentence fragment, a JS statment corresponds to a full sentence.
// A program is full of statements
// The simplest kind of statement is an expression with a semicolon after it.

// Example:
1;
!false;

// These examples are a useless program though.
