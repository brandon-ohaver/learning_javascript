// Often, raw code does not convey all the info you want a program to convey to human readers, or it conveys it in such a cryptic way that people might not understand it.
// At other times, you might just want to include some related thoughts as part of your program.
// This is what comments are for.

// A comment is a piece of text that part of a program but is completely ignored by the computer. 
// JavaScript has two ways of writing comments.
// To write a single-line comment, you can use two slash characters (//) and then the comment text after it

// A // comment goes only to the end of the line.
// A section of text betwe /* and */ will be ignored in its entirety, regardless of whether it contains line breaks.
// This is useful for adding blocks of information about a file or a chunk of a program.
