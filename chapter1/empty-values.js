// There are two special values, null and undefined, that denote the absence of a meaningful value.
// They as themselves are values, but carry no information
// Many operations in JS that don't produce a meaningful value, yield undefined as they have to yield some value.

// The difference between undefined and null is an accident of JavaScript design...
// But the difference ends up not mattering most of the time. If there is an instance where these values are used, then they can be interchanged

console.log(null)
console.log(undefined)
